                                                            Assignment â€“ 10
                                                     Joining a Table to Itself
1) Write a query that produces all pairs of salespeople who are living in the same city. Exclude combinations of salespeople with themselves as well as duplicate rows with the order reversed.


SELECT 
    s1.salesperson_name AS salesperson_1, 
    s2.salesperson_name AS salesperson_2, 
    s1.city
FROM 
    salespeople s1
JOIN 
    salespeople s2 
ON 
    s1.city = s2.city 
    AND s1.salesperson_id < s2.salesperson_id;
This query joins the salespeople table with itself using the city column to find salespeople living in the same city.
The condition s1.salesperson_id < s2.salesperson_id ensures that we do not get pairs of the same person (s1 and s2) and prevents duplicate pairs with reversed order.
2) Write a query that produces the names and cities of all customers with the same rating as Hoffman.


SELECT 
    c.customer_name, 
    c.city
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    customers hoffman 
ON 
    hoffman.customer_name = 'Hoffman' 
    AND c.rating = hoffman.rating;
This query joins the customers table with itself by matching the rating of all customers with that of Hoffman.
The condition hoffman.customer_name = 'Hoffman' ensures that the comparison is based on Hoffman's rating.
