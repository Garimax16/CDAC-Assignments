                                                       Subqueries.
 

1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).


SELECT 
    order_number, 
    customer_number, 
    order_amount
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    customer_number = (SELECT cnum FROM customers WHERE customer_name = 'Cisneros');
The subquery inside the WHERE clause retrieves the customer number (cnum) of the customer named Cisneros.
The outer query then fetches all orders related to that customer.
2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have above-average orders.


SELECT 
    customer_name, 
    rating
FROM 
    customers
WHERE 
    cnum IN (
        SELECT customer_number 
        FROM orders 
        GROUP BY customer_number 
        HAVING SUM(order_amount) > (SELECT AVG(total_order) FROM (SELECT SUM(order_amount) AS total_order FROM orders GROUP BY customer_number) subquery)
    );
The inner subquery calculates the total orders for each customer.
The main query compares the sum of the orders for each customer against the average order amount, and then selects the customers whose total order amounts are above this average.
3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.


SELECT 
    salesperson_number, 
    SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
FROM 
    orders
GROUP BY 
    salesperson_number
HAVING 
    SUM(order_amount) > (SELECT MAX(order_amount) FROM orders);
The subquery retrieves the largest order amount in the entire table.
The outer query calculates the total amount of orders for each salesperson and selects only those whose total is greater than the largest order amount.
