                                                      Assignment – 9
                                             Querying Multiple Tables at Once.


1) Write a query that lists each order number followed by the name of the customer who made the order.


SELECT 
    o.order_number, 
    c.customer_name
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customers c 
ON 
    o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
This query uses an INNER JOIN between the orders and customers tables on customer_id to list each order number along with the corresponding customer’s name.

2) Write a query that gives the names of both the salesperson and the customer for each order along with the order number.

SELECT 
    o.order_number, 
    c.customer_name, 
    s.salesperson_name
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customers c 
ON 
    o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN 
    salespeople s 
ON 
    o.salesperson_id = s.salesperson_id;
This query joins the orders, customers, and salespeople tables to retrieve the order number, customer name, and salesperson name for each order.

3) Write a query that produces all customers serviced by salespeople with a commission above 12%. Output the customer’s name, the salesperson’s name, and the salesperson’s rate of commission.


SELECT 
    c.customer_name, 
    s.salesperson_name, 
    s.commission_rate
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    orders o 
ON 
    c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN 
    salespeople s 
ON 
    o.salesperson_id = s.salesperson_id
WHERE 
    s.commission_rate > 0.12;
This query joins the customers, orders, and salespeople tables and filters the results to only include salespeople with a commission_rate above 12%.

4) Write a query that calculates the amount of the salesperson’s commission on each order by a customer with a rating above 100.


SELECT 
    o.order_number, 
    c.customer_name, 
    s.salesperson_name, 
    (o.order_amount * s.commission_rate) AS commission
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customers c 
ON 
    o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN 
    salespeople s 
ON 
    o.salesperson_id = s.salesperson_id
WHERE 
    c.rating > 100;
This query calculates the commission for each order made by a customer with a rating above 100. It joins the orders, customers, and salespeople tables and multiplies the order_amount by the salesperson’s commission_rate to calculate the commission.
