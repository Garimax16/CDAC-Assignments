1) Assume each salesperson has a 12% commission. Write a query on the orders table that will produce the order number, the salesperson number, and the amount of the salesperson’s commission for that order.


SELECT 
    order_number, 
    salesperson_number, 
    (order_amount * 0.12) AS commission
FROM 
    orders;
This query assumes that there is an order_amount field in the orders table representing the total value of the order.

2) Write a query on the Customers table that will find the highest rating in each city. Put the output in this form: "For the city (city), the highest rating is: (rating)."


SELECT 
    CONCAT('For the city ', city, ', the highest rating is: ', MAX(rating)) AS result
FROM 
    customers
GROUP BY 
    city;
This query uses CONCAT to format the output in the specified sentence form and MAX(rating) to find the highest rating for each city.

3) Write a query that lists customers in descending order of rating. Output the rating field first, followed by the customer’s name and number.


SELECT 
    rating, 
    customer_name, 
    customer_number
FROM 
    customers
ORDER BY 
    rating DESC;
This query lists customers in descending order of their rating, showing the rating field first, followed by the customer_name and customer_number.

4) Write a query that totals the orders for each day and places the results in descending order.


SELECT 
    order_date, 
    SUM(order_amount) AS total_orders
FROM 
    orders
GROUP BY 
    order_date
ORDER BY 
    total_orders DESC;
This query groups the orders by order_date, sums the order_amount, and sorts the result in descending order of the total orders for each day.
