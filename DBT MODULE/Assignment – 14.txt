                                                           Assignment – 14
                                              Entering, Deleting, and Changing Field Values.


1) Write a command that puts the following values, in their given order, into the salespeople table: city – San Jose, name – Blanco, comm – NULL, snum – 1100.


INSERT INTO salespeople (city, name, comm, snum)
VALUES ('San Jose', 'Blanco', NULL, 1100);
This command inserts a new row into the salespeople table with the specified values.
The comm (commission) field is set to NULL.


2) Write a command that removes all orders from customer Clemens from the Orders table.


DELETE FROM orders
WHERE customer_number = (SELECT customer_number FROM customers WHERE customer_name = 'Clemens');
This command deletes all orders from the orders table where the customer_number matches the customer named "Clemens".
It uses a subquery to get the customer_number for "Clemens" from the customers table.


3) Write a command that increases the rating of all customers in Rome by 100.


UPDATE customers
SET rating = rating + 100
WHERE city = 'Rome';
This command updates the rating of all customers located in "Rome" by increasing it by 100.
The WHERE clause ensures that only customers in "Rome" are affected.


4) Salesperson Serres has left the company. Assign her customers to Motika.


UPDATE customers
SET salesperson_number = (SELECT salesperson_number FROM salespeople WHERE name = 'Motika')
WHERE salesperson_number = (SELECT salesperson_number FROM salespeople WHERE name = 'Serres');
This command assigns all customers previously assigned to the salesperson "Serres" to the salesperson "Motika".
It uses subqueries to find the salesperson_number for both "Serres" and "Motika".
