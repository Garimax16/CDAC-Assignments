                                                        Assignment – 12  
                                              Using the operators IN, ANY, and ALL.  


1) Write a query that selects all customers whose ratings are equal to or greater than ANY of Serres’.


SELECT 
    customer_name, 
    rating 
FROM 
    customers
WHERE 
    rating >= ANY (SELECT rating FROM customers WHERE customer_name = 'Serres');
This query selects customers whose ratings are equal to or greater than any rating that customer "Serres" has.
2) Write a query using ANY or ALL that will find all salespeople who have no customers located in their city.


SELECT 
    salesperson_name 
FROM 
    salespeople
WHERE 
    city <> ANY (SELECT city FROM customers WHERE customers.salesperson_number = salespeople.salesperson_number);
The query compares each salesperson's city to the cities of their customers. It finds salespeople who do not have customers in the same city.
3) Write a query that selects all orders for amounts greater than any for the customers in London.


SELECT 
    order_number, 
    order_amount 
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    order_amount > ANY (SELECT order_amount FROM orders WHERE customer_number IN (SELECT cnum FROM customers WHERE city = 'London'));
The subquery first retrieves all order amounts for customers in London. The outer query then selects orders with amounts greater than any of those amounts.
4) Write the above query using MIN or MAX.


SELECT 
    order_number, 
    order_amount 
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    order_amount > (SELECT MIN(order_amount) FROM orders WHERE customer_number IN (SELECT cnum FROM customers WHERE city = 'London'));
This query retrieves all orders where the order amount is greater than the minimum order amount made by customers in London.
